    <h2 id="introduction">Introduction</h2>
    <p><strong>Bioluminescent milky seas</strong> are a fascinating natural phenomenon where large areas of <span style="background-color: yellow;">the ocean glow</span> with a blue or green light. This phenomenon is caused by bioluminescent bacteria that emit light when disturbed.</p>
    <p><em>Bioluminescence</em> is the production and emission of light by living organisms. It is a form of chemiluminescence, where light energy is released by a chemical reaction. In the ocean, bioluminescence is most commonly produced by bacteria, plankton, and some species of fish and squid.</p>

    <h2 id="causes">Causes</h2>
    <p>The primary cause of bioluminescent milky seas is the presence of bioluminescent bacteria, such as <em>Vibrio harveyi</em>. These bacteria emit light as a result of a chemical reaction involving the enzyme luciferase and the substrate luciferin. Lorem ipsum dolor sit amet consectetur adipisicing elit.

    <h2 id="research">Research</h2>
    <p>Recent research has focused on understanding the conditions that lead to the formation of bioluminescent milky seas. Scientists use satellite imagery and oceanographic data to identify and study these events. <strong>Studies have shown</strong> that these events are more common in certain regions of the world, such as the Indian Ocean and the Arabian Sea.</p>
